## Project Topic: Palmora Group HR Analysis

### Data Source

### Pointers taken note of during analysis

1. The gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and
departments
2. Insights on performance ratings based on gender
3. Analysis of the company’s salary structure to identify if there is a gender pay gap and identification of the department and regions that should be the focus of
management
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay
employees a minimum of $90,000
● Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:
● How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000,
etc.?
